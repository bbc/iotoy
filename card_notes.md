## Running stack of cards completed

* Auto-webAPI allows calling of functions with no arguments.
* Automated Web API allows getting / setting of device proxy attributes
* Move introspection code into python install area
* Make python code dev loop deb package based
* Device Proxy is autogenerated for stdio device
* Python API allows function calls with a return argument to a stdio device
* Python API allows function calls with 1 arg to a stdio device
* Python API allows basic function calls to a stdio device
* Python API presents something looking like a function to the user for a stdio device
* get/set python attribute gets/sets device attribute for stdio device
* Python spike for introspecting a device exists
* Test Host covers all useful introspection cases
* Test Host exists for testing API introspection
* Python subprocess access to an stdio iotoy host works properly
* It is possible to set the argument to the empty string as per spec
* C-API is introspectable
* BUGFIX: devinfo missing from funcs/help
* BUGFIX: funcspec for help, funcs and attrs misses off result name
* Serial API has draft docs
* C API 'command' support needs consistency
* BUGFIX: help in BotHostTiny was inconsistent
* BUGFIX: Calling "set" with no/missing value causes crash
* C API should mock serial IO via stdin/stdout
* BUGFIX: Fix host's resilience against being sent junk
* Initial Stdio Mock Serial exists, allowing fleshing out of core
* Mock build environment for C API is reinstated
* arduino-iotoy can be built/tested without the UI
* Break python spike up into first cut of modules
* Installation of arduino-iotoy for non-ubuntu hosts 
* Debian packaging for iotoy-libs
* Iotoy python installs in standard places
* Debian packaging for iotoy python
* Scratch implementation of the oven api exsts
* Github repository exists
* Arduino command host code exists
* Scratch API is completed and documented

## Current snapshot of cards to do...

* Auto Web-API functions accept parameters
* Call and return arguments are type checked/enforced
* Web Service return values conform to Web API spec
* Device Proxy has an autogenerated Web Service
* BUGFIX: introspect_test.py needs directory paths fixing
* Python API is autogenerated not crafted

## TBD
* Python Introspection spike is extended tyo a device connected on the serial port
* get/set python attribute gets/sets device attribute for serial device
* Python API is autogenerated from a device connected by USB
* OvenHostTiny matches build options for BotTest
* PPA for sparkslabs includes Guild and IOToy
* CommandHost Functionally equivalent to CommandHostTiny
* BotHost exists
* OvenHosts matches build options for the BotTest
* arduino-iotoy hosts can be uploaded to arduinos from the command line
* Python Host for building Raspi & "mock arduino" devices exists - Matches C serial API
* over_spike/arduino_proxy.py is generated from the serial communincations
* oven_spike/mdns_web_service.py is generated from the arduino proxy
* oven_spike/mock_arduino.py is split into a pythonhost & oven example

## iotoy ideas

* IOToy should use guild properly (simplify python code)
* IOToy APIs should compose via Flask (perhap - TBD)
* Website for iotoy exists
* Installation Documentation for iotoy C API
* iotoy spike API supports nested objects
* A means for identifying a unique device is practical
* Evaluate a suitable Binary JSON format

# Guild Ideas

* Basic TCP support
* Basic UDP support
* Core chassis support
* Pygame example
* Sprites for pygame
* Scratch-like (code) interface for Guild sprites/games
* Website for guild exists
* Proof of concept 80x50 RTP streamer exists
