## Running stack of cards from Trello

**NB** this isn't everything that's been done - just what's been done since the project started this approach to tracking.

# Pinned (done/old)

* Iotoy/Guild work public release has formal approval
* High Level Project Specs
  - A device provides an introspectable web API for monitoring and control
  - A device's functionality can be presented by a proxy onto the network
  - A device's functionality can be discovered
  - A device added to a home's internet of things can be added trivially
  - Framework is casual developer friendly
  - Security issues are identified and strategies formulated
  - Toolset enables the rapid creation of development spikes
  - Toolset enables UX centred IOT research

# High Level Plans

These could be termed facets rather than phases - since they're not strictly dependent on each other.

* ====== Phase 0 ====== [ COMPLETE ]
* Core Arduino, Core Python device side, core python client side, basic tests, etc exist [ COMPLETE ]

* ====== Phase 1 ======
* Analyse what is actually missing from the IOToy spec
* Device #1 is built and documented
* Device #2 is built and documented
* Device #3 is built and documented
* Javascript implementation of the Python proxy API
* Common service to allow javascript discovery

* ====== Phase 2 ======
* Multiple "Identical class" devices can be distinguished and controlled
* Local Devices in the network can be discovered and controlled
* Devices in the network can initiate events - and/or - Websockets are available for publication/subscription
* Devices in the network can be plumbed together

* ====== Phase 3 ======
* Public facing host for device proxying exists and is usable for one
* Ability to share control of public facing devices in a granular fashion encouraging safety.

# Things to do

## Current snapshot of cards to do...

## Next

* Additional notes on the WebAPI as it pertains to public accessibility
* PPA for sparkslabs includes Guild and IOToy
* Python Host for building Raspi & "mock arduino" devices exists - Matches C serial API
* IOToy service needs creating to replace the old bad one
* Test Arduino-iotoy hosts upload from commandline to Dagu Mini
* Test Arduino-iotoy hosts upload from commandline to DF Beetle
* Test Arduino-iotoy hosts upload from commandline to Faraduino
* A service exists looking for iotoy devices being plugged in

## iotoy ideas

* A means for identifying a unique device is practical
* iotoy/Python/README.md needs updating *alot*
* Exceptions from Auto-WebAPI are passed back in a uniform parseable form.
* Test arduino code on a DF Robot beetle
* IOToy should use guild properly (simplify python code)
* IOToy APIs should compose via Flask (perhaps - TBD)
* Website for iotoy exists
* Installation Documentation for iotoy C API
* The iotoy service supports multiple USB devices being plugged in
* iotoy spike API supports nested objects
* Evaluate a suitable Binary JSON format
* Mini Maestro + arduino control... http://www.darrenfeetham.com/18ssc.html

# Guild Ideas

* Basic TCP support
* Basic UDP support
* Core chassis support
* Pygame example
* Sprites for pygame
* Scratch-like (code) interface for Guild sprites/games
